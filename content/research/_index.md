My main interest of research is to find an intuitive way of animating characters. During my thesis entitled "Performance Transfer: Animating Characters by Playing and Acting", I've tried to find a method for creating expressive character animation sequences from Figurines plays. Moreover, we intrumented 3D printed figurines with HTC Vive trackers and capture their 6D trajectories, containning position and orientation data.
This work tackle three problems: Creating an animation sequence using one 6D trajectory, recognizing and transfering motion qualties and create multi character animations in a storytelling context.
