SkyEngine is yet another game engine I am working on together with co-workers and former studend collegues. The main goal of the engine is to implement recent research work to make video game and animated movie content easier to create. I would like to thank Julien Daval, Guillaume Cordonnier,Valentin Touzeau, Pierre Casati and Remi Galan Alfonso for contributing to this framework.
