My main interest of research is to find an intuitive way of animating characters. During my thesis untitled "Performence Transfer: Animating Characters by Playing and Acting", I've tried to find a method for creating expressive character animation sequences using 6D trajectories which contain position and orientation data of a physical prop trajectory (such as HTC Vive controllers).
This work tackle three problems: Creating an animation sequence using one 6D trajectory, recognizing and transfering motion qualties and create multi character animations in a storytelling context.
