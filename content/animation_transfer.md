### Space Time Doodle Transfer examples  ###
Below, I show transfered space-time doodles into animation sequences. It is important to note that all actions were learnt for the two first examples as well as for the garden example.

I personnaly think that those modifiers do the job as long as the animation phases are correctly defined. Still there are ways of improvment: first foot sliding should be removed for light and strong modifiers; secondly I should find a way to avoid light and strong motion to be too fast for some animations. This is due to the fact that some animations present long moments where there is no speed. 
I will try to redo the same parametrisation but using the affine speed instead.
