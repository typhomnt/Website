Welcome to my website. I'm Maxime Garcia, currently a PhD student working at Inria within the Imagine Team.
On this web site I'll be posting articles on my research results as well as articles on the Game Engine I develop.

My students can also find praticals topics and courses slides in the teaching resources section.

Finally, I'll also post some art related stuff since I sometimes take time to draw or do some 3D modeling.
